11/9/2018,Buyer,3,Yes,"In VBO, the issue was when the default posting date for a VBO advertisement changes from today's date to tomorrow's date. 

The ""sort of"" answer was that eVA VBO does not change the default date, but to recheck the date and time before you click on ""Submit"" and then verify that the pending ""Publish"" date and time is what you intended (always good advice).

Through ""trial and error"" I found that eVA VBO does not change the ""Publish"" date until after 2 PM.  In my test of this theory, when I opened a new Amendment to a VBO advertisement just BEFORE 2 PM, the default ""publish"" date stayed TODAY's date, but when I tried a new  ""Amendment"" for the same solicitation at 2:45 PM today, eVA VBO had changed the default ""Publish"" date to ""TOMORROW's"" date. 

NOTE:  Since this was only a test. I did not actually submit a new VBO posting.","Sherry, Specialist"

11/8/2018,Vendor,4,Yes,"Your support staff are GREAT. 

your online system is horrible.  The error messages are obscure, and don't provide any guidance as to how to resolve an issue;  the reinstatement form directs you to find your inactive company on a list that apparently it will never be listed on;  you require forms to be faxed in the digital age, when everything is a pdf.

I do not know the opening date and they are not listed in date order.  The new system is very time consuming and unorganized.  The old system had a much better search engine.

10/15/2018,Buyer,4,No,"The person who responded to my concern was very courteous and as helpful as she could be. However, our problem was not resolved and is ongoing. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the State W-9 form become embedded in the registration process for vendors and buyers. This way, the proper form will be filled out from the start and vendors, buyers and accounting staff will be less frustrated. As it stands now, vendors either provide no form or the Federal form. On the back side, it requires lots of follow-up and jeopardizes prompt pay problems. Vendors are frustrated because they will submit the federal form multiple times even though the COVA W-9 is sent to them with a request to fill out this specific form. The best way to streamline this process and ensure timely payments seems to be to embed the COVA W-9 in the registration process for vendors. They could sign it electronically. If the registration process is made smoother for all parties, we would all be appreciative and would be better equipped to be compliant with all requirements.","Miranda, Specialist"
10/15/2018,Buyer,4,No,We had a new vendor and had the vendor self-register.  The vendor was sent the State W-9 to be filled out and uploaded on the Eva site.  The vendor responded back stated he had registered.  We then issued a Purchase Order.  We are now ready to pay an invoice and Cardinal said there was not W-9 on record.  In researching EVA there was not a W-9 on record there.  So my concern is how can a Purchase Order be issued with out this if required. We are now chasing down to get a W-9 in both systems.  We may end up with a late payment which could have been avoided.  I feel there the Eva system should not allow a requisition or Purchase Order to be completed without the required documentation such as a W-9 if in fact it is required.   This give me great concern and have decided to set up an internal process to make sure this does not happen again.  It would also be helpful if the W-9 was required step in self-registering.  The other issue is Eva allows Federal W-9 and Cardinal does not so very often this also creates a problem.,"Miranda, Specialist"

Before the website was changed, it was a fairly simple thing to click on ""Transparency"" and then navigate to the appropriate box to find the ""Report and Resource Center"".  NOW, the ""Report and Resource Center"" isn't even listed anywhere on your home page or the subsidiary pull down lists!  A simple search yeilded NOTHING.  I even read through the Public Report and Resource Center Guide and it has NO INDICATION, WHATSOEVER, OF WHERE TO FIND THE REPORT AND RESOURCE CENTER!!!!!  Please, you must update the site to reflect the titles of the various locations that are linked to it.  It took a 15 minute wait on your customer service line--where a very cheerful and extremely helpful technician answered my call--to find that it was well hidden under ""Who Is Buying What I Sell""!  At the very least, list the titles of the various subsidiary locations as links on your home page.  Don't assume that a user, like me, will know what you intend when you use a title like ""Who Is Buying What I Sell.""  It is not very intuitive.","Jennifer, Specialist"

I trust this survey finds you all doing well and in great spirits.  
I reached out to the eVA Customer Care line because I had a difficult time locating the eVA Transparency Reports - don't get me wrong, I love the look of the newly updated platform, but I am hopeful, that eVA leadership may consider having a separate tab entitled ""TRANSPARENCY REPORT"". I think you will find that the eVA Customer Care line will receive less calls asking for assistance in locating the Transparency Reports. Thoughts? BTW, Jennifer was fabulous!  She got me to the reports in less than 30 seconds.  *snaps for Jennifer!*

7/31/2018,Vendor,1,No,"Three months after our terms of net 30 days ended we finally received payment. I easily spent five hours over the three months on the phone and computer working with people in eVA and VA Dept. of Health seeking to get concerns resolved.
Long before we received our payment, we were told we had to pay $35.50 to join the eVA system to get paid for our product. It seemed absurd that we the vendor had to pay eVA as part of the process to be paid for the product we provided. From beginning to end the eVA system was our nightmare. The people I interacted with were polite and tried to be helpful. It is the eVA system that appears to be impervious to the attempts made by myself and involved eVA and DOH staff to rectify the problem of not being recognized as a vendor by DOH.","Jennifer, Specialist"

When I called I explained this to the service rep and gave her the ""code"" that popped up.  I was told, ""we are not all fully familiar with the system"" and then she took me through pulling up the Quick Reference Manual.  She said she was 'pretty sure"" the answer would be included and then proceeded to instruct me how to get the manual.  I already had the manual and before calling I looked to see if the answer was in it but it was not.  Needless, I was able to figure out what the error was 'without help desk's help"".  I was not impressed with my first experience with needing the call the help desk.

7/10/2018,Vendor,1,No,"It has been well over one year where I have requested to have notifications to a specific mailbox discontinued - that mailbox is 'marketing@abm.com'.  The original account owner is no longer within the sales organization and is now the CMO of a multi-billion dollar company. This individual transferred this responsibility over to me and provided the necessary approvals for me to do so when I made the request last year some time to have the notifications discontinued. I was provided with instructions to self-service and when that didnt work, I called into the service desk and a CSR ""helped"" me do what I was unable to do.  We are over a year later and I am still receiving these daily notifications.  

If as a customer I ask for this service to stop, it should be stopped.  Instead, I am provided with instructions and yet another email to do again what didnt work the last time.  Do you see how this has lead to a not-so-great experience for me?  The CMO of this company and myself, a director, do not have this amount of time to dedicate to such a simple task. It should be unchecking a box and we should be done. It seems like I have done my part. If your company utilizes an inconvenient business system, this should not be something that is passed on over to your customers. 

ONLY discontinue the notifications to the 'marketing@abm.com' mailbox. There are notifications that go to other emails within our company that should remain.","Joann, Specialist"

I&#8217;m afraid I forgot her name, so this review is probably moot.  I have to mention that this is the first time I&#8217;m not blown away by eVA&#8217;s customer service.  Maybe the representative who helped me today is simply the first one I&#8217;ve come across at eVA who doesn&#8217;t like customer service.   As weird as it may seem, everyone I&#8217;ve spoken with before has given the impression of being actually eager to help.  Maybe it&#8217;s an act but it feels good.  Whoever I spoke with yesterday was also professional but lacked even the hint of a smile in her voice and came across as terse and impatient. She sounded exasperated with me when I ended up on some mirror home page.  Anyway, when I hung up, I was disappointed - which is no better or worse than if I&#8217;d gone to the DMV, I guess.

Any fees paid to these lawyers are set by the Code of Virginia. These lawyers or the law firms only provide legal services and do not solicit business through the procurement process; however, they registered in eVA to ensure payment for services would be paid through eVA/Cardinal system.  Most of these lawyers did not understand they could be a state entered vendor.  I am hoping this can be changed for lawyer/firms that provide court appointed legal services.","Jennifer, Specialist"

Department of Small Business and Supplier Diversity at (804) 786-6585 and SDV Section for eligibility  804-786-0286 do not have the slightest idea. SWaM had no idea.

1/31/2018,Buyer,5,No,"The customer care person that I spoke to was very polite and professional.  If I could rank her, the score would have been a 5.  But this survey is not set up in a way to provide specific information.  I initially contacted eVA customer care via email last Friday, and never received a reply.  According to the associate that I spoke to, I should have received an email on Monday, but did not.  If I could rank the online response that would be a 1.  Like I said, the specialist was very polite and she walked me through the registration process, so she gets a 5 for that.  When I go to register, I had a question so I call back eVA customer care, but they are unable to help and said I need to contact our regional representative, more low scores for that.  I should be able to get a routine problem resolved with one person.  But it was interesting calling the regional representative because she told me that my account would become deactivated every 90 days without use and the customer care at eVA said it would be 45 days.  Which one is it, more low points for two people with eVA not having the same information.  I have completed my re-registration and now I have received an automated email that it could take up to five days before my account is reactivated.  So that is why I checked off 'no' for the issue being resolved because it will not be until my account is activated again.  May be it will be activated sooner than five days.  When my account is activated, it will be resolved and not until then.  Like I said, the specialist was very polite and professional and she gets a 5 for her service, but low marks for the process and system in place, which is beyond the specialist's control, but someone at eVA can make improvements to the processes and system.","Miranda, Specialist"

Withholding information to make it hard for workers to get their job done, especially during a time crunch, is viciously inconsiderate and should be reported to the person in charge of the agency governing eVA!!!

REVIEW:
1. The last time that I reviewed the eVa portal to check for open bids was on Friday September 22nd   

2. On Sunday September 24th, we received an email notification informing us of an open opportunity  

3. On Monday, September 25th we log in to find the new bid, but notice that stated it had been available since September 20th

4. At this point, there have already been a couple of dozen candidates that had been submitted by other vendors 

5. I was told by Care Support to check the problem was not from our end

6. It is not our server and did not get sent to spam

* What can I do to make sure we are receiving the appropriate notifications to get a fair shot in these staffing opportunities?

He was also careful to explain that there was an internal process involved so it would take a few days.  He contacted me today to say the problem was resolved and I was able to confirm on my end that it was.  

He then went the extra mile to ask if there was anything else he could help with, and when I told him of a problem we were having with a State-entered vendor's record that we have been trying for weeks to resolve, he again identified the problem and has assured me that he will see it through to its resolution.

I tried to login to eVA this morning and I received a message stating that my account was deactivated. I emailed customer support to see if they could activate it. About an hour and a half later I received a phone call from customer support and was told that because I had not logged into eVA in 90 days that my account was deactivated and I had to reregister. OK, that is a pain in the neck but I went ahead and went through the registration process again. After completing the registration I received an email stating that I will have to wait 5 days for a password to complete my registration! That is completely unacceptable.

I strongly suggest that this process be revised. Accounts should not be deleted without warning and it certainly shouldn't take five days to receive a password under any circumstance. This is very inconvenient since I have orders that I need to place on eVA right now.","Jennifer, Specialist"

5/3/2017, Buyer,5,No,"Called Natasha (who was great and tried to find the solution).  A department eVA account holder needed to cancel an order.  Instead of cancel they selected to change, and deleted the one and only line item and then selected cancel, not submit.  This resulted in the V2 going into ""Cancelling"" status and a V3 change.  After sometime, it was suggested I contact our agency eVA integration lead.  So I reviewed the order,  I first edited (thanks to change manager role), and I selected to ""undo"" the deletion of the line item.  Then I had the user select to edit the V3, then exit, delete.  This put the order back to ""ordered"" status.  I had her attempt to ""cancel"" and was immediately put back in the loop of the V3 cancelling and a V5 (not 4) in submitted.  So I repeated my former steps.  Then I edited and changed the PR to a zero dollar amount and entered ""This event was cancelled"" and submitted. The PR is flowing through approvals.  I am suspecting when this goes to Ordered status, I could have the user ""cancel"" in the normal way.  Wanted to share. I know the undo feature is not friendly to integration.  This is a good example.","Natasha, Specialist"

One issue that could be beneficial to Vendors is to narrow the scope of bids to the territories selected. For example, our company services Northern Virginia only and have selected this territory, however we receive bid solicitations from Richmond, and many areas outside of our territory.

Otherwise, a great experience.

So my feedback really pertains to registration only, I just picked a category code because I couldn't find anything remotely related to sports officiating, nor even General or ""Not Applicable"".

I do believe Lakeia addressed this to me in her phone call, I just don't remember what it was I was supposed to do. I will submit a new request shortly. I'm confident we'll get it sorted out quickly.
