I had no idea what about the process I was inquiring about hence there was an error regarding my legal name. I only logged into the account once to take care of paperwork to be a vendor for VA state agency and that was in October. I told her I had to call back because I could tell the experience was not going to end well. I called back moments later to speak with another care rep, who was great! Walked me through the steps and when I was confused she elaborated and cover other questions I had without even having to ask. She would get a 5! The first rep, a 0 if that were possible...especially since an HR rep from the agency just gave your customer service help desk a great review when telling me who to contact for the issue.",4,"I think the rep&#8217;s name was Miranda (youthful, cheerful voice).

Sherry said all they had to do was send you a link so that we could see and have access to the requisition.   Issue was the vendor was missing an ""s"" on the first word.

I did not see any contact info on Ariba site.  I realize their service was probably outsourced, since it orginates with eVA. I called eVA.  Sherry answered the call. I explained my concern, she said you have to call them and gave me their number 866-218-2155.  
It turns out that number is totally automated, they say if you are a  vendor press #3, then PO question, press # 2, when you follow the promps, it ends with, we have transitioned all our help, click on the link on the right side.  Then it disconnects. REALLY?  I'm sorry, I like and expect good customer service and that is far from it. 
So I called eVA back, this time I got JoANN.  SHE IS AWESOME.  She deserves a raise!!  Anyway I explained my concern again, I told her about automated number and that I needed to talk to a person.  She actually called the automated number to see how to reach a person. She came back on the phone with a heavyily accented man, that sounded like he just woke up.      I proceeded to say I realize the PO only stays in their system for 14 days ( unless I ugrade). I was not aware of that earlier. I said I would like help or instructions on using your system.  I dont know what happen the call disconnected.  

I think it would be helpful, if there was some kind of instruction booklet or webinar for using Ariba.

For instance one of them is for rescinding NOIA in the system.  Not only are we doing this once but just today I requested to do it again to the same procurement.  She immediately contacted CGI to have IFB 2701 set to bids opened.  So basically I am trying to say the eVA Customer Care does an outstanding job.",5,"First of all I Love eVA!  I have been using this system off and on since around 2001 as a pilot in DOC.  While at DOC I used every aspect of eVA but while at VDOT we utilize the Quick Quote and now the Sourcing and Contracting tool.  Since using the Sourcing and Contracting piece I can see several things that eVA needs to take a look at.  I recommend changing or simplifying the following:  
1.  IFB 2683 is 66 Line Items - The way that it prints out one or two line items per page.  Therefore, this is 26 pages long.
2.  In order to condense this maybe we can consider - Removing these fields if NOT REQUIRED - Discount Information, Specs, Manufacturer, Manu Part #, Product Number, Serial Number, Specification Number, MSDS Info (NOTE: MSDS is now SDS), Comments, Haz. Mat., Handling Instr., Packing Instr., Detailed Instr. and Additional Instructions.  These fields may be nice for goods but are not needed for most Service Contracts. (Maybe the Buyer Can choose which fields they would like to use?

I am sure there is more and I will pass info on as I see things that can better the system.

However, I subsequently received an email from Minerva Blake that confirmed my account/registration is now Active. So all in all my issue was resolved, but there are many improvements needed to the directions on the W9 and communication.",5,"As previously stated I had a good experience overall. However, the instructions on the W9 need to be updated. It should state that single owner LLC's that are ""Disregarded Entitite"" should put the name of their Business in the ""Business Name"" field (instead of their name). In addition, the instructions states that a signature is not required; but then on the initial rejection I received it stated that a signature is required. This needs to be clarified.  Also, digital signatures are significantly more secure than physically written and scanned signatures and should be accepted by businesses to reduce steps in signing documentation from businesses. Last, I know that my account is now active, but do I still need to physically sign and re-submit my W2? According to one of the many email responses I received I need to physically sign and return my W9. I worked with several people via 2 phone calls and do not remember if I spoke with the same person.

We used to get Solicitations and Quick Quotes emailed to us, which was much more helpful. On those Solicitations and Quick Quotes, we could easily identify if the opportunity fit our needs. They contained the agency name & location, the buyer&#8217;s name and contact info, the product info, etc. It would also tell you if it was a Solicitation or Quick Quote.

The EVA Leads Summary does not list all of the relevant info that your traditional format did.You have to now login and find the opportunity.

Now, we are missing Leads. There were two recent paper bids/quotes that we were not sent to us on the EVA Leads Summary. Then, today, after one of the quotes had expired, we received the Lead for it. I have emailed that example to Portia in EVA Customer Care in hopes that EVA will fix this problem.

9/24/2019,SWaM (SBSD),5,Yes,Yes,Portia was very helpful with my question and even more patient in listening to my opinion in regard the new way that eVA is batching together emails.  Please see my comments below.,5,"My comments are in regard to eVA instituting the way solicitations/QQs are emailed to vendors.

This new method seemed to come unannounced a couple of weeks ago.  
My first constructive comment is questioning why vendors were not polled to learn how many are pleased vs. displeased with the volume of emails coming from eVA.  I would have been glad to participate and always respond to eVA correspondence when requested.  Perhaps a poll would have put me in the minority &#8211; but one never knows unless one has a chance to participate.

I was told when I called about this that vendors had complained in regard to the volume of email being received.  I cannot quite see how this makes sense.  The same volume of solicitations/QQs are being received by a given vendor, the emails are now just batched together &#8211; now based on a date, rather than subject matter.  So now, as a vendor, I have to sort through a given email and see from 2 to 10+ varied solicitations/QQs that have no relationship to one another.  
As an example, I open your email and see the 10 or so additional links, which I now must sort through and click on again to take a closer look to make sure it's clear what is being solicited.  Let's say I am interested in 2 of the 10 (varying agencies). I can't simply now save that email in one electronic folder (organized by agency in my case), but rather have to keep it ""live"" so that I can follow details tracking the pre-bid, due date, addenda, etc.  If I&#8217;m interested in 3 (varying agencies)&#8230;.it&#8217;s a mess to keep track.

As far as a vendor who was complaining about too many emails:  my response to that vendor would be that he/she review their codes, perhaps they have listed to many - after all, they are getting THE SAME AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC, just batched together in a HAPHAZARD fashion.  If the vendor does not have many codes listed in the system, then they are not getting that many emails (right?).  Also, inboxes for most emails are not limited in this day and age, so again, if the vendor is getting too many emails &#8211; then he/she needs to clean up their codes with eVA.   I can't seem to make sense of the new strategy...?  Before, I received one email for one solicitation/QQ.  If the email subject is too vague (agencies all vary in how they title them), then just open the email and can quickly see if it is something our company wishes to pursue or not.  If so, I can save that email in the respective folder I have for that agency.  If not, I can delete it and quickly move on.  With the new way they are batched together &#8211; it basically is taking me A LOT MORE (almost double) time to sort through it all and keep it organized.  

In trying to remaining constructive (and not just be a complainer), the only way I can see this making any sense would be to batch on a daily basis BY AGENCY.  For example, quite often on Fridays, VDOT comes out with myriad solicitations/QQ &#8211; often 10+.  Although I STILL prefer separate emails, I can see a case being made to batch those together.  Similarly, often a local govt/public body will put out a series of solicitations/QQs for upcoming work all at once based on their fiscal year, etc. &#8211; again, this would make sense to batch together in an email.  But that might be difficult for eVA IT to isolate as such and therefore (again) just give each their own email!

Our company purposely chooses and thrives on having a lot of codes with eVA &#8211; we find that we come across unexpected opportunities from this strategy.   We have been kept very busy using your system over the last 5+ years and are pleased and satisfied to pay our bill each quarter.  I thank you for your time and kindly request that you seriously consider to re-instate the previous system &#8211; one email for one solicitation/QQ &#8211; it is clearly a more efficient way to approach conducting business together.

I thank you for your time &#8211; S. Todd Weinberg, Manager &#8211; Paisley Kerr LLC 804-919-5555
